You can also now select a character from the counters section to receive a random hero which counters the one that you selected. </p> <p> The main purpose of the hero generator is for displaying which heroes are good for certain situations, and for randomly choosing the hero for you. Even though it is always best to pick the hero you are good with yourself, it's sometimes more interesting to generate a random hero and only play as them in quickplay. Blizzard even made a weekly brawl based on this very idea before. It's fun to challenge yourself to try your best, even when the hero you play as is not good for the specific situation. However, if you do want to still be useful to your team with the random hero generator, then there are options that will generate the hero with certain conditions. However, you should remember that   this tool is intended for quickplay, custom games, or the arcade only. DO NOT USE THIS FOR COMPETITIVE! ";
