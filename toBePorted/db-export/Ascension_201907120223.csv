1,Waking up,"Where am I?
I woke up here, in this room. I can't remember anything, I don't know what happened. Everything hurts... My feet, my hands, my head, everything.
I can't remember who I am, what my life was before this.
All that exists is this room and this terminal.
It's a dark, square, matallic room, the area is maybe 4 metres in each direction and around 2 metres tall. There's a single light that's flush with the ceiling and it's permanently on. The walls are a cold and made of a dark-grey metal.
There is a computer screen and a keyboard at one wall with a sort of journal program turned on. That is what I'm writing with now. It's asking me for my name and the date but I swear I don't know. My mind is empty.
