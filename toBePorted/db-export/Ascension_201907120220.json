My feet, my hands, my head, everything.\r\nI can't remember who I am, what my life was before this.\r\nAll that exists is this room and this terminal.\r\nIt's a dark, square, matallic room, the area is maybe 4 metres in each direction and around 2 metres tall. There's a single light that's flush with the ceiling and it's permanently on. The walls are a cold and made of a dark-grey metal.\r\nThere is a computer screen and a keyboard at one wall with a sort of journal program turned on. That is what I'm writing with now. It's asking me for my name and the date but I swear I don't know. My mind is empty.\r\n...\r\nI'm scared.",
