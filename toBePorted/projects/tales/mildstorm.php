<p>And so, the young lad continued to sprint away from the foreboding danger that was the spoopy skellington.</p>
<p>"Prithee, peace!" screeched the skellington, although the lad did not heed his pleas.</p>
<p>Once in a safe haven, the lad encountered a dench lad by the name of Propane; the young lad felt no need to look twice at the dench lad - the limited edition fedora and jailbait bodypillow was all Propane required to establish his place in society: as Memechief of the island. The young lad bowed like a worthless slave, and introduced himself as Fedindo, an ardent child. Propane thus showed Fedindo "Murt", his beautiful daughter, who was really fucking hot, let me just say. Murt paid little attention to Fedindo, who acted abnormally amongst other women.</p>
<p>"rawr! *nuzzles your chest* omg lol! u r so cute! *tips fedora adorably*" squeaked Fedindo.</p>
<p>"Get the fuck away from me, you degenerate," snapped Murt, "What even are you?"</p>
<p>Although it was clearly obvious that this angelic babe had no interest in him, Fedindo could not help but admire Murt with fervour; he was especially fond of her big feet, which made his pee pee go hard.</p>
<p>On one occasion, while Propane was away with his spirit, "Font: Arial, Size: 12" doing something involving parmesan, Fedindo advanced upon Murt, who absent-mindedly ate her fucking fingers. Like seriously, what the fuck. Anyway, within seconds, Fedindo was caressing her toes, which he quite liked because they reminded him of sweet potatoes, which he thinks are pretty radical. Nevertheless, little did this cool kid know, alas! she hath been triggered! Forsooth! Growing rainbow-dyed hair and horn-rimmed glasses with instantaneous effect, Murt morphed into a feminist and rolled into the ocean, where she sailed towards Haiti. Yes, Haiti. There, she encountered a sexy Armenian by the name of Samvel, who gave her a carton of eggs before they participated in violent love-making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Propane retured with Font: Arial, Size: 12 to find Fedindo weeping like a little bitch over his lost waifu. He got really upset at him for being so naughty, and chased him away from his humble abode, while Font: Arial, Size: 12 remained, polishing his tush. Once away from the Memechief, Fedindo exclaimed with surprise, due to his sudden discovery of two young boys, Saxophone and Trinculo. Before he could do something really fucking nasty to them, they were already mounting him like a noble steed, and pounding him to a pulp. Little to say, Fedindo did not look good afterwards, because he had a gash on his forearm and his knee hurt quite a bit, which kind of sucked. However, little did the three retards know that watching from a nearby brothel was the slave to the young boys, Cory in the House. He interrupted the circlejerk, warning the boys of an oncoming hazard from the east, but they did not heed his warning. Within seconds, a group of Crusaders had arrived, to their mild discomfort.</p>
<p>"Cheers, love," sang the Crusaders, "the cavalry's here!"</p>
<p>Saxophone and Trombone, retracting their balls from the depths of hell that was Fedindo's asscrack, ran away from the scene of the crime, got married, bought a house and started a family, I don't really know. Fedindo and Cory in the House slowly gazed up at the knights, who Fedindo could swear smelled like a mixture of mustard and paint thinner. They were both soon at their knees, praising the Crusaders for such an act of courage, although they were soon hoisted onto their feet.</p>
<p>"Cease thy faggotry," boomed a Crusader, "also, do you want to leave this island now? The script says you have to, so I don't really know what you can do about it."</p>
<p>"omg, yus! :3 lol lmfao *smiles sweetly*" said Fedindo.</p>
<p>Fedindo was lead onto their ship, the S.S Blitzkrieg, with his new companion, Cory in the House, who was know ejecting salty water from his tear ducts. Together, the lit squad towards the horizon, in search of a cool adventure that might actually make a sequel, but who knows.</p>
