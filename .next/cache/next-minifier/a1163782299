DataTool is a tool used to extract data from Overwatch (aka datamining). DataTool is a command prompt based tool so it can be difficult and time-consuming to use for people who are less experienced with command prompt. Because of this, the DataTool GUI in the OW Extract Toolkit provides a graphical user interface which allows you to use the main functionality of DataTool without typing in commands. It\\'s as simple as clicking a button. I did not make DataTool itself, but I did create the GUI.</p>\\n        <p>Simple setup instructions:<p>\\n        <ol>\\n            <li>Click the \"Download\" button above to visit the GitHub releases page for OWET.</li>\\n<li>Click on \"OWExtractToolkit.exe\" or \"OWET.zip\" below the latest release to download the latest version.</li>\\n<li>Extract OWExtractToolkit.exe anywhere.</li>\\n<li>Open OWExtractToolkit.exe</li>\\n<li>Open the settings menu and make sure the Overwatch game path is correct</li>\\n<li>Press the &quot;Download Latest DataTool&quot; in the settings</li>\\n        <p><image src=\"https://i.imgur.com/flwuipT.png\"></p>\\n        <p><image src=\"https://i.imgur.com/R6dcwdR.png\"></p>\\n '}},[[\"L4Od\",1,2,0,28]]]);"}
